# Hall Effect Sensors Board (comparators)

KiCad project of the board for the comparators for signal coming from Hall effect sensors.

It's based on the [LMV393](https://github.com/DB375237/smarties/blob/master/pdf/lmv393.pdf) low voltage comparator.

(required only for "analog" Hall sensors - not used in the prototype built - ** UNTESTED DESIGN **)
